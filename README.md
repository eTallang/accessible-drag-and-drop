# Accessible drag and drop demo

This is a demo on how to use drag and drop on a web page, and still make it accessible for those who prefer to use keyboard as their input method.

## How to use
List items can be reordered or moved between lists by dragging and dropping using the mouse. The same functionality can be achieved using the keyboard by first selecting the item that should be moved. Moving the item is then performed by using the arrow-buttons on your keyboard.
