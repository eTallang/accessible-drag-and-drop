# Accessible drag and drop demo

This is a demo on how to use drag and drop on a web page, and still make it accessible for those who prefer to use keyboard as their input method.

## Hos to use
List items can be reordered or moved between lists by dragging and dropping using the mouse. The same functionality can be achieved using the keyboard by first selecting the item that should be moved, and then using the keyboard-arrows by moving the item up or down in the list, or between lists.
